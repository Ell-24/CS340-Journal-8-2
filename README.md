There are many ways to keep programs maintainable, readable and adaptable. One example that was utilized within this project was implementing CRUD. By using CRUD we had a simple yet robust way to address all needs to make this program maintainable, readable and adaptable

As a Computer Scientist I try to keep my approaches as adaptable and flexible as possible. I know that there will be a variety of situations that I encounter that require unique responses and solutions. In this situation with Grazioso Salvare, I kept the client in mind and tried to meet their needs. From there I explored my knowledge and toolsets to try and provide them the most effective response I possibly could. 

Computer Scientists have deep diverse toolset that can be applied to many scenarios and situations. In this case with Grazioso Salvare Computer Scientists were able to provide a program that can efficiently handle a database and utilize numerous widgets and outputs for this data to be handled and read easier. In this case computer scientists were able to provide a service and product that is able to deeply affect the efficiency of a company. This is one example of the numerous advantages and solutions that Computer Scientists are capable of.
